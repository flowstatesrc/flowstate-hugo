  simple:
    title: Simple and fast
    content: "![Simple](images/yellow-lock-icon.png) Log JSON events through our open-source client libraries in Python, Javascrpt, Ruby, PHP, or any language that can use a C shared library. Uploads the data in the background to reduce performance impact on your user-facing processes. Live tail and search stored logs efficiently and see log entries in context."
  dashboards:
    title: Dashboards and Metrics
    content: "![Custom Dashboards](images/performance.svg) Create custom live dashboards and graphs which are powered by JSON. This currently requires javascript programming, but the benefit is it's fully customizable with no artificial restrictions." 
  cheaper:
    title: Simple pricing 30x lower than the market leader
    content: "Compared with the market leader's on-demand pricing of $6.15/M events with 60-day retention vs our on-demand pricing of $0.20/M with 90-day retention." 
  custom:
    title: Programmable
    content: "![GraphQL](images/graphql.svg) Run custom javascript event handlers to filter/transform/mask data, add to dashboards, or trigger alerts or take action. Don't be constrained to the features we've built, write code to fit your needs exactly."
  alerts:  
    title: Alerting
    content: "![Audit Logs](images/audit.svg) Integrates with Slack and PagerDuty, send emails or SMS alerts to specific people or groups depending on the event."

  pluses:
    title: What we do well
    content:
        - We care about every single customer, all our employees, including the CEO, do customer support.
        - The interface is simple and easy to use.
        - You can use regex-based searches (for those of you missing grep).
        - Command-line client for searching log events.
        - If you just want to centralize all your logs and search them, that's our bread and butter.
        - We allow fully programmable dashboards and triggers, so you can solve some problems that you can't with other services.
        - Straightforward low prices with no surprises.
        - Unlimited users and hosts at no extra cost.
  minuses:
    title: Why we might not be a good fit
    content:
        - Currently our list of features is relatively short.
        - Our dashboards currently require custom programming. If you want to create dashboards by pointing and clicking, you'll be disappointed.
        - We don't currently support analytical data analysis or SQL queries. This is not a general purpose data warehouse solution.
        - We don't yet support as many programming languages as some other services.
        - We're a new company.
